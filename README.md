# Hello World

This tutorial walks you through enough Javascript to get started with D3.js. I wrote this tutorial to help others, who may not have a background in Javascript, use the D3.js library to visualize data and make awesome data products.

## Caveats

## You will not become a Javascript ninja from this tutorial

Instead, we focus on selected basics of Javascript; just enough to get you to understand D3.js and be effective with the library.

## You will not master D3.js from this tutorial

The D3.js library is quite extensive and powerful. It contains too much to cover in a basic tutorial such as this. Instead, we focus on the Javascript that you need to know in order to not feel lost when using the library. Later on in the tutorial, we'll walk through example D3.js code that produces a basic plot.
